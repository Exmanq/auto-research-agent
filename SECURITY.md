# Security Policy

- Do not commit secrets; use environment variables for API keys.
- If a token leaks, rotate immediately and open a private security issue.
- Validate/sanitize data from external providers.
- Keep dependencies updated; CI runs lint/tests on PRs.
- Report vulnerabilities privately to the maintainer.
